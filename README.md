# C4-TTT-AI-solvers

Random player, alpha-beta pruning and Q-learning players for Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT) and Connect 4 (C4).

Choose the two players in the `play` method: 'H' for human, 'B' for baseline near-random player, 'M' for minimax player, 'Q' for Q-learner.

Q tables provided for TTT, must be generated for C4 due to size constraints (>1.5GB for a good player).
